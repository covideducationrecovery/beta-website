    <h2>About this site</h2>
    <p>The purpose of the COVID-19 Global Education Recovery Tracker is to capture ongoing information about the global
      status of schools, teachers and students amid the COVID-19 pandemic. This information is intended to be of use for
      education and public health policy stakeholders and researchers from around the world. In this second year of the
      pandemic, and as many countries are starting to move from emergency responses towards policies aimed for recovery,
      the tracker aims to support this process by focusing on data that can help build back better and more resilient
      education systems.</p>
    <p>This tracker is the result of a partnership between the <a href="https://equityschoolplus.jhu.edu/">Johns Hopkins University eSchool+ Initiative</a>, the <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/">World Bank</a>, and <a href="https://www.unicef.org/">UNICEF</a>.</p>

        The <strong>Johns Hopkins University eSchool+ Initiative</strong> is a cross-disciplinary collaboration between
        the Johns Hopkins Consortium for School-Based Health Solutions, Berman Institute of Bioethics, Rales Center for
        the Integration of Health and Education, and the schools of Education, Medicine, and Public Health. It was
        formed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in order to develop tools and resources for schools to think
        responsibly about caring for students during school closures and reopening. The initiative benefits from
        expertise in ethics, school health, school policy, food security, clinical medicine and education.
