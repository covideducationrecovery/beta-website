    <h2>Methodology</h2>
    <p>
      This tracker displays data for more than 200 countries and territories across the globe. (See <a
        href="/about/#disclaimer">Disclaimer</a> for
      additional information about the term &quot;country.&quot;)
    </p>
    <p>
      Each partner was assigned a portfolio of countries for which to collect data from publicly available data
      sources. Information from publicly available sources was obtained from departments/ministries of education,
      health, state-sponsored COVID-19 dedicated websites, and news sources. Any news source was verified with at
      least one additional secondary source. The tracker reflects the most currently available data at the time of
      each round of survey completion.
