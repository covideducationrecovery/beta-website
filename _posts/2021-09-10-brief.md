description: "The COVID-19 Global Education Recovery Tracker, sourced by teams across the World Bank, Johns Hopkins, and
UNICEF, monitors recovery planning efforts in more than 200 countries and territories. The latest data shows that most
countries have already opened schools partially (rural areas or parts of the country) and mostly with hybrid (combining
remote and in-person) or mixed approaches."

    <h4>School Opening Status</h4>
    <p>Latest data from the <a href="https://www.covideducationrecovery.global/">COVID-19 Global Education Recovery
        Tracker</a> <sup><a href="#footnote-1">1</a></sup> shows that most countries have already opened schools partially (rural areas or parts of the
      country) and mostly with hybrid (combining remote and in-person) or mixed approaches. In many countries, the
      return is slow in the midst of debates about costs and benefits of returning to presential education. However, as
      of late August, very few countries depend solely on remote education. On the other hand, in Africa, a majority of
      countries have returned to in- person classes. In the northern hemisphere, the 2021-22 school year has begun or is
      about to begin, but it takes on the shape of a “new normal” as most are expected to return to in-person with
      additional sanitary protocols and adjusted schedules.</p>

    <p>While high-income countries are prioritizing or have prioritized <a
        href="/stories/2021-07-09-vaccination-for-teachers/">teacher vaccination</a> campaigns (with some moving
      towards universal access), the context varies more among low- and middle-income countries as many factors,
      such as vaccine scarcity and other populations being prioritized, reduce access to COVID-19 immunizations for
      teachers. As of September 1st, only 53% of countries had prioritized teachers’ vaccination.</p>

              To advance the catch up on content, the first two weeks of school will be a continuation of the
              remedial education programs that were launched August 15th, then the year’s curriculum will be
              introduced. In preparation, Jordan has prioritized teacher vaccinations and has reported that over 90%

          Countries are implementing diverse protection measures, as well as changes in schedules and school

            vaccinated people</a>. The CDC recommends universal indoor masking for all teachers, staff, students,
          and visitors to K-12 schools, regardless of vaccination status. Children should return to full-time
          in-person learning in the fall with layered prevention strategies in place. <a

          considering mandating regular negative PCR tests from vaccine-hesitant parents as the country prepares to
          return to face-to-face education. <a href="/profile?sa">Saudi Arabia</a>’s school year will switch to a

          emerged on the need to reopen schools as football stadiums, restaurants, and malls are back in operation.

            the use of hybrid learning across the country</a>, through a pilot starting mid-September. In <a

            A study in <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3841775">Brazil</a> (Sao Paolo),
            where data was collected at the beginning and the end of 2020, shows that students learned 27.5% of what
            they would have learned if in-person classes had continued as usual.

              href="https://riseprogramme.org/blog/learning-inequalities-widen-COVID-19-Ethiopia">Ethiopia</a>
            showed that children only learned between 30% to 40% as much in math as during a normal year, and that
            the learning gap between urban and rural students has increased.

            messages and phone calls to encourage parents to support their child’s learning while out of school can
