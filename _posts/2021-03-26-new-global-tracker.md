      <p><b>March 26, 2021</b>—The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted education for <a
          href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/immersive-story/2021/01/22/urgent-effective-action-required-to-quell-the-impact-of-covid-19-on-education-worldwide">1.6
          billion children</a> worldwide over the past year. To help measure the ongoing global response, Johns Hopkins
        University, the World Bank, and UNICEF have partnered to create a <a target='_blank'
          href="https://equityschoolplus.jhu.edu/">COVID-19 – Global Education Recovery Tracker</a>.</p>

      <img style="max-width: 610px; margin: 1rem auto" src="/img/og-image.png">

      <p>Launched today, the tool assists countries’ decision-making by tracking reopening and recovery planning efforts
        in more than 200 countries and territories.</p>

      <p>The effort captures and showcases information across four key areas:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Status of schooling</li>
        <li>Modalities of learning (remote, in-person or hybrid)</li>
        <li>Availability of remedial educational support</li>
        <li>Status of vaccine availability for teachers</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The Global Education Recovery Tracker seeks to build upon Johns Hopkins University’s pivotal work in gathering
        quality data on COVID-19 cases, testing, and vaccinations, along with the strategic roles that the World Bank
        and
        UNICEF play in operational and policy support to countries during the pandemic.</p>
      <p>“Throughout the pandemic Johns Hopkins has demonstrated the vital role for universities in providing accurate,
        evidence-based data and information for the world,” said Johns Hopkins Provost and Senior Vice President for
        Academic Affairs Sunil Kumar. “We hope the work of this partnership will build understanding of how COVID-19
        continues to affect students everywhere.”</p>
      <p>Data through early March 2021 show that 51 countries have fully returned to in-person education. In more than
        90
        countries, students are being instructed through multiple modalities, with some schools open, others closed, and
        many offering hybrid learning options.</p>
      <p>Regionally, there are emerging indications of shifts in learning modalities. Remote learning continues to
        dominate in the Middle East and North Africa where schools were largely closed in recent weeks.&nbsp;However, in
        Sub-Saharan Africa, most students are physically attending school. In the East Asia and Pacific region,
        in-person
        education has mostly resumed, with stringent social distancing measures.&nbsp;The regions of South Asia, Central
        Asia, and Europe are mainly relying on hybrid education where the infrastructure allows.&nbsp;Across Latin
        America, countries are using mixed approaches that include remote, hybrid, and in-person education. However, the
        majority of schools remain partially or fully closed to in-person classes with remote education as the most used
        modality.</p>
      <p>“The world was facing a learning crisis before COVID-19,” said Jaime Saavedra, World Bank Global Director for
        Education. “The <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/education/brief/learning-poverty">learning poverty
          rate</a> – the proportion of 10-year-olds unable to read a short, age-appropriate text – was 53% in low- and
        middle-income countries prior to COVID-19, compared to only 9% for high-income countries. A year into the
        pandemic, continued disruptions to schooling, shifts in learning modalities, and concerns for students’
        well-being
        are ever greater, and this learning crisis is getting worse. COVID-19 related school closures are likely to
        increase learning poverty to as much as 63%.”</p>
      <p>Saavedra emphasized the importance of this Tracker, “In many countries, students and teachers need urgent
        supplemental support. The return to school requires accelerated, remedial, and hybrid learning, as well as other
        interventions. Collecting and monitoring this data on what countries are doing is critically important to help
        us
        understand the magnitude of what support is needed as we go forward, learning from the major trends observed
        among
        countries.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      <p>In addition to tracking the operational status of schools, the Tracker will also monitor how students are being
        supported. This includes changes to the school year schedule, tutoring, and remediation, especially for the
        primary school grades. These interventions will be a critical component of the education recovery process after
        a
        year that has affected the learning and well-being of 95% of school children across the globe.</p>
      <p>In countries where the COVID-19 vaccine is available, the tool is tracking whether teachers are eligible as a
        priority group. As of early March, teachers are largely not being immunized as a priority group in low- and
        low-middle-income countries. Of the 130 countries where vaccine information was available,&nbsp;more than
        two-thirds are not currently vaccinating teachers as a priority group.</p>
      <p>“Even as vaccines are beginning to rollout worldwide, for hundreds of millions of the world’s schoolchildren,
        the
        consequences of this pandemic are far from over,” said UNICEF Chief of Education Robert Jenkins. “We must
        prioritize the reopening of schools, including prioritizing teachers to receive COVID-19 vaccines once frontline
        health personnel and high-risk populations are vaccinated. While such decisions ultimately rest with governments
        making difficult tradeoffs, we must do everything in our power to safeguard the future of the next generation.
        And
        this begins by safeguarding those responsible for opening that future up for them.”</p>
      <p>The Tracker is intended to offer evidence that informs policy makers and researchers working on COVID-19
        responses.&nbsp; The tool is built to have the flexibility to incorporate emerging issues while offering a time
        trend of actions in the past months.</p>
